## Introduction

## Project Prerequisites

1. Set up [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating)
2. If using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), download the [Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

VS Code has the ability to auto-format your files on save. If you want to auto-format on save, then you'll have to go into the VS Code settings and enable `Format On Save`. This will format your files according to the project's prettier settings (specified in the `.prettierrc` file).

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:Pod-Tracking/pod-tracking-web.git
```

Install/use the correct node version:

```
nvm use
```

**NOTE:** If you don't have the node version specified in the `.nvmrc` file, this command will install it and start using it. If you already have the correct version installed, NVM will switch to that node version.

Install node modules:

```
npm i
```

Run the project locally:

```
npm run dev
```
